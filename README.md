# **Password Check**
## **Overview**
Leverages the Active Directory powershell module to poll for users whose passwords are within 7 days of expiration.

An e-mail notification is sent to users whose password expires within 7 days. Users continue to receive e-mails until their passwords are changed or expired.

*Note: You will need your own Mailgun account to make this work, or feel free to fork/branch and add your delivery method.*

## **Use**
Password check is designed to be run as a scheduled task.

### Inform Mode
By default, password check runs in "user mode" which means it alerts users according to the script. When run with the -inform switch, the script will send a report of ALL users expiring in the next $warndays days to the $informemail rather than sending messages to users.

`c:\users\myself\documents\passwordcheck.ps1 -inform`

### Test Mode
Allows you to specify an e-mail address to send a test expiration notice to. No error handling built in so make sure the e-mail address is correct before you fire it off :D

`c:\users\myself\documents\passwordcheck.ps1 -test nukelearghost@github.com`


### Permissions
The script needs only enough permission to read the DisplayName, EmailAddress, and msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed attributes in AD

### Configuration

You will need to fill in the following data in order to make this function:

- variable name - description - line number
- $informemail - E-mail address for sending inform report - 8
- $warndays (optional) - How many days to warn user before password expires (default 7) - 11
- $url - Mailgun API URL - 46
- $auth - Mailgun API Key - 49
- $message (optional) - The message sent to users whose passwords are expiring -  (112 - 115)
